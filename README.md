# Website Crawler with PDF Conversion

This application crawls websites, converts HTML pages to PDFs, downloads existing PDFs, and runs on a scheduled basis.

## Features
- Recursive website crawling with BFS algorithm
- HTML to PDF conversion using headless Chrome
- PDF downloading with deduplication
- Scheduled periodic crawling
- Comprehensive logging and JSON reporting
- Configurable parameters (depth, rate limiting, etc.)
- Threaded processing for efficiency

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required packages: `playwright`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, `apscheduler`, `pdfkit`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asiebHasan/devotrix.git
cd devotrix
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pdfkit
apt-get install wkhtmltopdf #download wkhtmltopdf for windows OS
```
3. Edit the configuration  as needed.

Configuration contains these settings:

```bash
[CRAWLER]
CONFIG_FILE = "crawler_config.ini"
OUTPUT_DIR = "website_archives"
LOG_DIR = "crawler_logs"
MAX_THREADS = 5
MAX_DEPTH = 5
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0 
```
4. Usage
Run the crawler:

```bash
python fdic.py
python lexic.py
```
The application will:

Perform an initial crawl

Schedule periodic crawls based on configuration

Generate PDFs in website_archives/

Create logs and reports in crawler_logs/

## Sample Report

# Notes
The Lexis URL is commented out in the code due to its complexity and anti-scraping measures

Adjust max_depth and max_threads based on website size and server capabilities

The scheduler runs in the background - use Ctrl+C to stop the application

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - BFS algorithm for website traversal
   - HTMLâ†’PDF conversion using Playwright
   - PDF downloading with session management
   - APScheduler for periodic execution

2. **Bonus Challenges**:
   - **Duplicate Detection**: MD5 checksum verification
   - **Logging & Reporting**: Comprehensive logs + JSON reports
   - **Smart Filtering**: Keyword-based URL skipping
   - **Performance**: Thread pooling with rate limiting
   - **Code Quality**: Modular OOP design + config management

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Depth-limited crawling
   - Anti-bot evasion techniques
   - Dynamic content rendering
   - Error resilience
   - Configurable parameters

4. **Lexis Advance Handling**:
   - Specialized URL processing
   - Headless browser rendering
   - Session persistence
